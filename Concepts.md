1. What is the difference between SLO, SLI, and SLA 


SLI (Service Level Indicator):
Definition: SLI measures a specific aspect of a service's performance, quantifying a critical metric or behavior for overall functionality or user experience.

Example: Common SLIs include response time, error rate, and availability percentage.

SLO (Service Level Objective):
Definition: SLO is a set target or goal for a specific SLI, defining the acceptable level of performance or reliability over a defined period.

Example: Examples of SLOs include "99.9% availability" or "Response time below 200 milliseconds."

SLA (Service Level Agreement):
Definition: SLA is a formal agreement or contract between a service provider and its customers, outlining expected service levels. It includes SLOs and consequences for not meeting them.

Example: A cloud service provider's SLA might guarantee 99.9% uptime, with potential service credits or compensations for non-compliance.

In Summary:

SLI: Measures a specific service aspect.
SLO: Sets a target or goal for an SLI.
SLA: Formal agreement with SLOs and consequences.

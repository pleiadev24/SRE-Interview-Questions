What is the difference between an incident and a problem

Definition:
An incident is an unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of an IT service. It may involve issues such as a service outage, performance degradation, or any other service-related problem that impacts users.
Characteristics:
Incidents are typically events that disrupt normal service operations.
They are often unexpected and can happen at any time.
Incidents are usually isolated events affecting a specific user, group, or service.
Management:
The primary goal is to restore normal service operations as quickly as possible.
Incident management focuses on minimizing the impact of the incident on the business and restoring service functionality.
Examples:
System crashes, application errors, network connectivity issues, hardware failures, etc.
Problem:
Definition:
A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. It is an unknown root cause that, when identified and addressed, can prevent the recurrence of incidents.
Characteristics:
Problems are the result of deeper issues within the IT infrastructure.
They are identified through the analysis of incidents and recurring patterns.
Problem management aims to identify and resolve the root cause to prevent future incidents.
Management:
The primary goal is to identify and address the root cause to prevent recurring incidents.
Problem management focuses on proactive analysis and long-term solutions.
Examples:
Software bugs, misconfigurations, hardware faults, capacity issues, etc.
Relationship:
Incident to Problem:
Incidents are often symptoms of underlying problems.
When an incident occurs, it is managed through the incident management process.
If the incident is recurring or has an unknown root cause, it may be escalated to problem management for further investigation.
Problem to Incident:
Problems are often identified through the analysis of incidents.
Once the root cause is determined and a solution is implemented, it can prevent future incidents.
